# Emergency-System

Project Overview:
Developed a robust emergency management system for an Emergency Service Center aimed at optimizing ambulance dispatch for patients based on the severity of their condition. The system effectively prioritizes and manages emergency calls, ensuring patients with higher triage levels receive prompt attention.

Key Features and Responsibilities:

Patient Record Management:
Designed and implemented modules to capture and store patient details, including Name, Phone Number, Triage Level (severity from 1 to 5), and Location.
Developed a mechanism to assign unique IDs to each patient upon receiving their call, ensuring seamless tracking and identification.

Priority-Based Dispatch System:
Created a sophisticated waiting list system that prioritizes patients based on their triage level.
Implemented a priority queue to ensure patients with higher triage levels are assigned ambulances first. If multiple patients share the same triage level, the system prioritizes those who arrived earlier.

Efficient Data Handling:
Utilized Javaâ€™s OOP principles to ensure the codebase was modular, maintainable, and scalable.
Employed data structures like priority queues and linked lists to efficiently manage patient data and dispatch orders.

Collaborative Development:
Worked closely with a team of developers to integrate the system with other components of the emergency management software.
Participated in code reviews and collaborated on system design to enhance functionality and user experience.

Impact:
The system significantly improved the efficiency and response time of the Emergency Service Center, ensuring that critical patients received timely medical attention and streamlined the overall process of ambulance dispatch.
